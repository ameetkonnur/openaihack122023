In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC. We quickly worked with the TD Team on this POC and were able to show 50% improvement in Search Results for the null Search Phrases. We were also able validate this concept as a viable option by leveraging our extended teams who were working on something similar at Flipkart as well.
This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.

Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC. We quickly worked with the TD Team on this POC and were able to show 50% improvement in Search Results for the null Search Phrases. We were also able validate this concept as a viable option by leveraging our extended teams who were working on something similar at Flipkart as well.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.In March 2023, during an Exec Connect TD's CEO Pratik mentioned about improving their Search Experience. Knowing that Google Retail Search is being used currently and our Engineering Teams prioritizing work on OpenAI we may not have the bandwidth to engage (background our Azure Search & Bing Search had engaged earlier), it was agreed that we will get back to it in the next 3- 6 months.
We then connected with the ground team over the next few weeks to get a sense of what these issues could be. One of the things that stood out was they have a significant number of null Search Results given a Search Phrase. It was likely due to no product matches or poor understanding on what the customer wanted to purchase.
As a priority in this account we always had this in our mind to replace Google presence with Azure Native or Azure Partner solutions. When we broadly got access to play around with OpenAI, we found that it has the potential to make Search Experience better by understanding Intent of the customer better including search terms in mixed languages Hindi, English, Hinglish. This was also one of the points that Cognitive Search didnt do well in during our initial POC days. In May 2023 we created a small Web App that takes a Search Phrases and showed the Intent detected by OpenAI as the output. We shared the Web App to one of their Lead Architects to test and provide feedback. Based on his feedback we modified the Web App and re-published them. We now had one person with a mind-share for the solution. We then leveraged our entire v-team to share this broadly across multiple teams in TD. We persisted on following up with all the stakeholders on this and eventually in June 2023, the Search Product owner & AI Team took it up as a POC.

This engagement over the last 4 months helped us create the Opportunity, Qualify it and proceed ahead with POC and get it to Commit.
